I didn't start writing this change log from day one hence it will look a bit odd.

November 7, 2019
================
Happy Great October Revolution day to everybody! Sorry I am from a wrong(?) age. In school we celebrated this date which was originally October 25th
this is why they call it October revolution although it happened in November.

Added documentation
-------------------
Added documentation using sphinx. Brunt of text was added to scene.py which has the most code.

Started to build out Scorpion Room
----------------------------------
Added code to Scorpion room. Players have 15 seconds to find a way out or through.

New script in bin directory: Restart_game
-----------------------------------------
New script added that deletes all previous game states and sets one for the opening scene: Player1 in reception room having nothing but a pair of sun glasses.
