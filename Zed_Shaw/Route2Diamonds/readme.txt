In Lesson 45 (Learn Python the Hard Way by Zed Shaw) students are tasked to create a Zork like game from scratch. Their code must be organised into several files which import from each other as logic requires.

To add a little twist to the above my game saves progress into an MySql database. Database details (name, user name and password) could be found in db_connect.py. It could surely be much easier (probably more elegant) to sort this volunatrily taken part of the task with the help of pickle. It wasn't my intention. I deliberatly wanted to go down this route. 

db_connect can help you with creating and spawning databases please check its methods.

This is a fully functioning program (main.py to start with) but rooms are unfinished. Only reception, meat room, knife room were implemented. If I have the time I will do the rest. You can do that too. Rooms are in scene.py. Study existing rooms and follow their lead. It will make your rooms nicely tie in.

Combat engine is out of scope.

Implementing a non db version is out of scope.
